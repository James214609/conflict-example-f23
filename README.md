Merge conflicts happen, DO NoT fear them!!!!!!!

This is content that Was most defintely added through the GitHub interface. I am purposely causing a merge conflict.

This sentefnce was added locally using the GitHub desktop app.

This is a repo that is being used, in class, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention!
