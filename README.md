This is Content that was added through the GitHub Interface. I am purposely causing a merge conflict to show the class.

Thid sentefnce was addedd Locally in github desktop app.

This is a forked repo that is being used, in class, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention.
